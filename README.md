# Nimble - Pathfinder Tokens

A simple module that maps the tokens from the [Pathfinder Tokens: Bestiaries](https://www.foundryvtt.store/products/pf2e-tokens-bestiaries) module (commercial) to the Nimble System built-in actors.

In simple words, it allows you to use your monster tokens from Paizo with Nimble.
